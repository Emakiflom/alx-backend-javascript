# 0x05. NodeJS Basics

## Overview

This project is focused on the basics of Node.js, covering how to create simple scripts, read files, set up HTTP servers, and use the Express framework. You will also learn to handle command-line arguments and the environment, use ES6 with Babel, and improve development speed with Nodemon.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Run JavaScript code using Node.js.
- Utilize Node.js modules.
- Read files using specific Node.js modules.
- Access command-line arguments and environment variables using `process`.
- Create a basic HTTP server using Node.js.
- Set up and create advanced routes with an Express.js server.
- Use ES6 features with Node.js via Babel.
- Use Nodemon for faster development.

## Project Requirements
